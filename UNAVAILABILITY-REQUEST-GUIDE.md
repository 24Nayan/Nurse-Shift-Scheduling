## ⚠️ Common Issues

### "Submit Request button is disabled"

**Reason:** You haven't completed all required steps

**Solution:** Check that you have:
1. ✅ Added at least one date (see the list of unavailable dates)
2. ✅ Selected a "Valid Until" date (the field with the red asterisk *)

### "This date is already added"

**Reason:** You're trying to add the same date twice

**Solution:** 
- Remove the existing date first (click X)
- Then add it again with different shifts if needed

## 💡 Tips

1. **Add multiple dates at once** - No need to submit separately for each date
2. **Set a realistic Valid Until date** - Usually the last date you'll be unavailable
3. **Provide a reason** - Helps administrators prioritize and understand your needs
4. **Check the list** - Review all added dates before submitting
